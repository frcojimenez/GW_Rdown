GW_Rdown
The GW_Rdown project aims to produce accurate ringdown (RD) models that describe the final state of binary black hole (BBH) mergers. 
The BH RD emerges as the late trail of radiation usually represented as a sum of damped sinusoids and their modelling is essential to produce tests of general relativity GR in its most extreme regime.  
In this repository one can find: i) codes to generate the models ii) data describing the QNM spectrum and iii) data resulting from fits informed by numerical relativiy (NR) waveforms.
